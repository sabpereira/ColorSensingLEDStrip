# Color Sensing LED Strip

This repository conatins the documentation and relevant files for the Color Sensing LED Strip controller. 

## Project Overview
The Color Sensing LED Strip controller enables the user to set the color of a DotStar LEDs strip by choosing to scan a light source of a desired color to replicate (such as from a phone), select the desired RGB values, or choose from a preset selection of colors, including the last color scanned. Please review the video below or [click here]( https://youtu.be/J2j3cKCgywg) for a demo of the controller in action.

The user interface displays text and menus OLED ".96 display, with selections made through the use or a rotary encoder.

The display is divided into two sections. The top section is the DisplaySpace. Here is where menus, message boxes, configuration screens, and the application's main displays are shown.

Displayed on the screen's bottom line is the ButtonBar. Mounted just below the LCD are two push buttons. The function of these buttons change, so the ButtonBar is used to label what the push buttons do. Typically the left button will be labeled Select and the right one Back.

Two more buttons are used, one to go Up and the other to go Down. These are mounted to the right side of the LCD.
